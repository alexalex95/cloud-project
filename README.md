Website to upload documents and files to a database
The purpose of this website, is to manage a document and file uploader to a database in which you can edit and modify if you need to. 
It is made for an educational purpose but can be used in many other proyects.

This project begins with the login page in which you can register as a student if you don't have an account
then, you can sign up to the classes that you are participating and in which you are required to upload the files 
the teacher needs to approve you before you can start uploading your files
then, you can send your files, the teacher can download them and grade them and also gives them a feedback.

The website was made in spanish for a university project.

Any other question, let me know.
